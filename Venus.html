                            <p>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Venus is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Venus likes to keep things simple.
                            </p>
                            <p>This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Venus takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Venus goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on Venus, you’d have a birthday every three months!</p>
                            <p>A day on Venus is not like a day here on Earth. For us, the sun rises and sets each and every day. Because Venus has a slow spin and short year, it takes a long time for the sun to rise and set there. Venus only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days! Isn't that weird?

                            <h2>Facts about Venus</h2>
                            <p>    Venus has been known to humanity since ancient times and although its discovery date is unknown, the first mentions of the planet are believed to be around 3000 BC by the Sumerians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            A year in Venus is 88 days, yet a Venus day is 176 Earth days. Venus is nearly tidally locked to the Sun – also known as a gravitational lock – and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun.</p>
                            <p> Venus orbits so quickly around the Sun that early civilizations believed it was actually two different stars – one which appeared in the morning and another which appeared in the evening.</p>
