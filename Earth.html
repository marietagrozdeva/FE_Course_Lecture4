                            <p>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Earth is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Earth likes to keep things simple.
                            </p>
                            <p>This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Earth takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Earth goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. If you lived on Earth, you’d have a birthday every three months!</p>
                            <p>A day on Earth is not like a day here on Earth. For us, the sun rises and sets each and every day. Because Earth has a slow spin and short year, it takes a long time for the sun to rise and set there. Earth only has one sunrise every 180 Earth days! Isn't that weird?

                            <h2>Facts about Earth</h2>
                            <p>    Earth has been known to humanity since ancient times and although its discovery date is unknown, the first mentions of the planet are believed to be around 3000 BC by the Sumerians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            A year in Earth is 88 days, yet a Earth day is 176 Earth days. Earth is nearly tidally locked to the Sun – also known as a gravitational lock – and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet to almost match its orbit around the Sun.</p>
                            <p> Earth orbits so quickly around the Sun that early civilizations believed it was actually two different stars – one which appeared in the morning and another which appeared in the evening.</p>
